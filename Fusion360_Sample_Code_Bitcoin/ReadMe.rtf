\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Attached is the Fusion 360 Wax bit coin file.\'a0 Please note that the finishing tool "used for tool paths 2 and 3" is a .031 ball endmill rather than a 45degree tapered endmill.\'a0 This will change the look of the finished product compared to that of the bit coin in the Kickstarter Video.\'a0 The tool paths of this Fusion 360 part are only for wax.\'a0 Using harder materials may damage your machine or break tooling.\'a0 The file contains 3 tool paths in total.\'a0 The first tool path roughs out most of the wax using a .062 flat endmill like that of the one shipped with each FR4 kit containing a spindle. Please note that the material is 1.55" x 1.55" and should be more than .25" thick. The zero point of the work piece is the top center of the material.\'a0 The first tool path "Bit Coin Roughing.ngc" can be found in the .zip folder.\'a0 Users should should be cautious running "Bit Coin Roughing.ngc".\'a0 Pocket NC is not responsible for any damage caused by the use of the provided programs so users should proceed with caution. \'a0}
